CLKC-15#1 Advisory
MMCME4 clkouts drive nothing  
The MMCME4 cell vcu118_sys_clock_mmcm1/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst CLKOUT* pins do not drive anything. It may be that the MMCM is only present because of a DONT_TOUCH directive. Consider removing the DONT_TOUCH to let Logical Optimization remove the MMCM or else manually remove it from the design.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-28#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with BUF_IN drives sequential IO not with CLKOUT0  
The MMCME4 cell vcu118_sys_clock_mmcm0/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst has COMPENSATION value BUF_IN, but CLKOUT3 output drives sequential IO cells. In order to achieve insertion delay and phase-alignment for the IO sequential cells, a COMPENSATION of ZHOLD must be used and CLKOUT0 output must be the driver.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-40#1 Advisory
Substitute PLLE4 for MMCME4 check  
The MMCME4 cell vcu118_sys_clock_mmcm0/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst has a single input clock whose source driver, IBUFCTRL sys_clk_ibufds/IBUFCTRL_INST (in sys_clk_ibufds macro), is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
